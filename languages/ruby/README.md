# Ruby

## About this Repository
This repository is a collection of exercises, projects, and notes that I'll be creating as I learn Ruby. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to learn Ruby, with a focus on practical examples and real-world applications.

## What You'll Find Here
**Exercises**: A series of exercises that cover the basics of Ruby, including data types, control structures, functions, and more.

**Notes**: My personal notes and summaries of Ruby concepts, including syntax, best practices, and common pitfalls.


## Getting Started
If you're new to Ruby, I recommend starting with the `language fundamentals` in the `language-fundamentals` directory. These exercises are designed to introduce you to the basics of Ruby and help you build a solid foundation.

As you progress, you can move on to the projects in the projects directory. These projects will give you hands-on experience with Ruby and help you apply what you've learned to real-world scenarios.
