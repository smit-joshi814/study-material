# Database Exploration (RDBMS & NoSQL)
This repository serves as a central location for exploring the fundamentals and advanced concepts of both Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and NoSQL databases.

## Subdirectories
This repository is further organized into three subdirectories, each focusing on a specific database type:

 - **rdbms-basic**: This directory contains code examples and exercises related to the basic functionalities of RDBMS. You'll find demonstrations of data definition, manipulation, and querying using Oracle RDBMS.

- **rdbms-advanced**: This directory delves deeper into advanced RDBMS concepts like normalization, transactions, concurrency control, and stored procedures. The code examples will showcase how to implement these features within your RDBMS environment.

- **nosql**: This directory explores the world of NoSQL databases. Here, you'll find code examples demonstrating the use of popular MongoDB.
